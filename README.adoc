== What version of Zig to use

Right now we are following [master](https://ziglang.org/download/), but once 0.11.0 is released, we will be switching to the latest stable version of Zig.

== FYI: LLVM issues

Currently LLVM is having trouble lowering AVR when this is built in debug mode:

[source]
----
LLVM Emit Object... Don't know how to custom lower this!
UNREACHABLE executed at /Users/mattnite/code/llvm-project-15/llvm/lib/Target/AVR/AVRISelLowering.cpp:842!
----

for now always build in release small:

[source]
----
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
